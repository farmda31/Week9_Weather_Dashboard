# Week9_Weather_Dashboard
  
## Description
I created an application that allows users to connect toe the openweathermap.org site to check the weather for their area. 

## Installation
To use the application, no installation is required, however, you will need to access the site at openweathermap.org and request your own unique API.
Once you have your own API Key, you'll need to updat ethe .env file located at Week9_Weather_Dashboard/Develop/server/.env and provide your API key value on Line 2.
The user will need to open this application on their Visual Studio, run the application and start the server.
Once the server has started, the user can type in the city name or zip code where they would like to check the weather.

## License
There is no license required to use this applicaiton.
