# Week9_Weather_Dashboard
  
## Description
I created an application that allows users to connect toe the openweathermap.org site to check the weather for their area. 

## Installation
To use the application, no installation is required. 
The user will need to open this application on their Visual Studio, run the application and start the server.
Once the server has started, the user can type in the city name or zip code where they would like to check the weather.

## License
There is no license required to use this applicaiton.
